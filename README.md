Currently this library have one data structure "line" (just array and its length) and functions required to work with it (line_make..., line_reduce, line_map, line_filter, line_combine, line_copy, line_compare, line_select, free_line, etc.). 
Check line.h for details. 
Tests are written using Unity framework.
Currently makefile is used only for most basic purposes like building and running tests (makefile test).
